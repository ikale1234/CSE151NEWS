# Introduction
Our model aims to use machine learning to predict whether a news article is fake or not. The reason we chose this was because in the digital age, there is so much confusion and misinformation being spread. This project aims to try and find nuances in the language of these titles as well as find biases. This would not only present a challenge for a machine learning model, but it would help promote the trustworthiness of news articles. This combination of understanding language patterns and applying machine learning would not only be solving an important real world problem, but it would also show the diverse ways that AI can be used in our world. The importance of having a good predictive model is that it would allow the public to discern fake news from regular news. This would help not only our democracy but also our society as a whole to be able to trust and be better informed about current events.
