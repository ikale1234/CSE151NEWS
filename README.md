### Overview
This project explores text classification for identifying fake news articles. Utilizing advanced natural language processing techniques and machine learning models, the goal is to improve prediction accuracy for imbalanced datasets.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned and transformed text data into features like lexical diversity, average word lengths, sentence counts, and more.
   - Dropped unnecessary columns and separated data into features (X) and labels (y).

2. **SMOTE for Balancing Classes**  
   - Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to address class imbalance, ensuring equal representation of classes in the training data.

3. **Models Explored**
   - **First Model:** Logistic Regression  
     Explored with various regularization strengths and plotted fitting graph for training and testing error rates.  
   - **Second Model:** XGBoost Classifier  
     Tuned parameters such as `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`, and `max_depth`.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Used classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance on training and testing datasets.

### Results

#### Fitting Graph Analysis:
The fitting graph reveals the following insights:  
- The XGBoost classifier achieved optimal performance with training error around **0.04** and testing error around **0.09**, demonstrating that the model is well-fitted with minimal overfitting.
- Logistic Regression fitting graph showed higher error rates for lower regularization (`C`), indicating that increasing `C` improved performance up to a certain threshold.

#### Second Model Performance (XGBoost):  
- **Training Accuracy:** 96%  
- **Testing Accuracy:** 91%  
- Demonstrates robustness and good generalization compared to the first model. 

#### Next Models to Explore:  
- **Random Forest Classifier:**  
   To investigate ensemble methods with high interpretability. Itâ€™s less sensitive to outliers and can handle feature interactions better.
- **Deep Learning Approaches:**  
   LSTMs or transformers (e.g., BERT) to better capture the sequential structure and semantics of textual data.

### Conclusion

#### Model 1 (Logistic Regression):  
- Achieved moderate accuracy but struggled with complex feature interactions.
- Improvement Suggestions:  
   Use polynomial features or feature engineering to better capture non-linear relationships.

#### Model 2 (XGBoost Classifier):  
- Outperformed Logistic Regression with significantly better metrics. The SMOTE-balanced training data contributed to this improvement.  
- **Potential Improvements:**  
   - Hyperparameter optimization via grid search or Bayesian optimization.  
   - Use advanced NLP embeddings (e.g., TF-IDF vectors or word embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe) to enhance text representation.  
   - Experiment with dropout or other regularization techniques to minimize overfitting further.

### Questions Answered

1. **Where does your model fit in the fitting graph?**  
   The XGBoost model fits well, with low training and testing error rates. In contrast, the Logistic Regression model struggles with higher error, particularly for lower regularization values.

2. **What are the next models you are thinking of and why?**  
   - Random Forest for ensemble learning benefits.
   - Deep learning models like BERT for capturing complex relationships in text.

### Conclusion
- The second model (XGBoost) significantly outperforms the first (Logistic Regression), achieving better accuracy and generalization.  
- Future efforts will involve exploring more sophisticated models and refining feature extraction techniques for further improvements.readme
